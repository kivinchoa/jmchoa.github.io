      <title>回家了</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2018年2月8日凌晨两点左右终于安全抵家，但回家的感觉与在国外想得的不一样。适应了一个新环境，旧的环境以前再熟悉仍然会感觉不适应。落了一年的灰，家里的东西不仅乱，而且布满了灰尘。还有就是家里东西太多，经过一年的积累，从国外又带回了大小箱子一共12个，可想而知在家里会占多大的空间。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;回家最不便的是网络，由于网络监管严格，很多网站都无法访问，即使能访问其速度也非常慢，特别是第一次访问该网站，本机还没有绶存的情况下会更慢。有意思的是，即使本机虚拟网站也无法访问，所以要想写类似的博客，还得断网调试。&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Farewell to RPEMS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To all the teachers in RPEMS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff from class 607 will leave RPEMS and would like to appreciate your teaching last year. He spent wonderful time in this great school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff is from Xi&amp;rsquo;an city in China. He came to RPEMS at his fifth grade on Feb 2017. At the beginning, he can not understand the teachers in the class. He learned English as the second language from Ms. Goldenberg. After half year, he entered into the sixth grade, I am glad that he can understand most words of teachers and classmates. He can communicate with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of this semester in September, Mr. Zimmermann gave him a book titled /Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry/. I encouraged him to read it 10 pages everyday according the teacher&amp;rsquo;s requirements. He read it and listening the records. Finally he completed it. He found the interests from reading. From that on, he began reading a lot. He also read Chinese traditional novel. He has completed reading /Romance of the Three Kingdoms/, a 14th-century Chinese historical novel. Later as assignment, Mr. Zimmermann gave him another book titled /Walking on the Moon/. After reading, he got 100% score from test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He likes mathematics. He can calculate fast because he practice a lot in China. Ms. Calalang often praised him. In this semester, IXL was used to assign homework after class. At beginning, Jeff don&amp;rsquo;t like it at all because score can be reduced 10 points after only one error. Sometimes he repeated it many times for final 100 percent by spending more than two hours. Now he is used to it and likes it. When he is back home, he firstly completes the IXL homework. He know he can get 100 percent only if he works hard on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geography is the most difficult course for Jeff. He has no background about the geography. There are many terms what he never heard about. He did not complete homework very well at the first quarter of this year round. Later I taught him by interpreting the files attached on Edmodo by Mr. Williamson. He got broad knowledge from Middle East to Africa at the class of geography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science is another interesting class. Jeff learned matter state, atom, element periodic table and so on. Jeff completed a project about buoyant force. He surfed the internet, watched vedio from YouTube, and read downloaded documents. He did experiments to test if the hot water has the lower buoyant force compared with the cold water by use of bottled water floating in the basin. Finally he got the expected conclusion from the experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.E. has no homework. Jeff learned how to play 5 different balls. But he can not get basketball because he is not tall enough. He said he can run very fast in 3 minutes with no stop. Sometimes he felt muscle ache after P.E. I told him that&amp;rsquo;s very common after exercising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff took ESOL class twice or three times each week charged by Ms. Goldenberg. He made big progress after one year&amp;rsquo;s English learning. He likes ESOL class. He made good friends in this class. Ms. Goldenberg would collect talking pieces from students and encourage them to discuss them thoroughly in the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth to mention that Jeff took part in the North Bay Camp. He often mentioned the experience in North Bay. He likes it very much. That&amp;rsquo;s the first time for him to leave us by himself. I know that he must do some stupid thing in that time. But he really grown up since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally Jeff and our whole family would express our heartful appreciation to all the teachers in RPEMS again. We got wonderful experience from RPEMS. Living here for one year would be the most unforgettable experience for us. We hope you living a joyful and healthy life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best regards,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff and his family&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>忙并快乐着</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;今天琢磨了一天的Hugo，搭建了这个非常简单的博客网站。遇到了很多问题，但基本上解决了，还没有加入评论功能。了解到Hugo除了有主题，还有网页的模板，网页模板控制着网页的显示形式，配制更麻烦。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;看来再简单的东西也得学习，而且学得越多，觉得越难。Hugo是搭建静态网页比较简单的工具了，基本不用自己面对Html文件，只要做一些简单配置即可生成静态网页，以便在网络上发布，非常适合博客编写。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;结合Git动态更新网站内容，可以用于发布通知等信息。网站还可加入订阅功能，这样用户就可以收到动态更新的信息了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;类似这样的工具还有很多，不能不说这是一种创新，便于人们分享认识。关健一点，这些工具都是免费、开源的。&lt;/p&gt;
